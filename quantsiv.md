# Quantsiv — Quantum Risk Management Platform

## The Name

**Quant** — quantum.  
**Siv** — sieve.

The **General Number Field Sieve** is the most powerful classical algorithm for factoring large prime numbers. It's the mathematical wall that makes RSA unbreakable today. Classical computers can't get through it fast enough.

Shor's algorithm on a quantum computer makes the sieve irrelevant. It factors in hours what would take classical computers millions of years.

The name works on two levels:
1. **We sieve through your codebase** — filtering out quantum-vulnerable cryptography from everything else
2. **The sieve is what's breaking** — quantum computers are destroying the mathematical wall that protects the world's encryption

**When someone asks:**
> *"Quant — quantum. Siv — sieve. The sieve is the mathematical wall that makes your encryption unbreakable today. Quantum computers are about to tear through it. Quantsiv finds where you're exposed before that happens."*

## The Threat — Why This Market Exists

Almost everything secure on the internet today — bank logins, HTTPS connections, API authentication, encrypted emails, VPN tunnels, digital signatures — is protected by three algorithms: **RSA, ECDSA, and Diffie-Hellman**. They work because factoring very large numbers is computationally impossible for classical computers.

A sufficiently powerful quantum computer running **Shor's algorithm** makes factoring trivial. RSA-2048 falls in hours.

Current quantum computers can't do this yet. But the active threat is happening now:

> **"Harvest now, decrypt later."** State actors and sophisticated adversaries are capturing and storing encrypted internet traffic today. They can't read it yet. When quantum computers mature (est. 2029–2035), they decrypt everything they stored. Your 2026 financial records, medical data, or trade secrets become readable in 2031.

Data that needs to stay confidential for 10+ years is already compromised if it's been captured in transit.

## Regulatory Context

- **NIST** finalized three quantum-resistant algorithm standards in August 2024:
  - CRYSTALS-Kyber (ML-KEM, FIPS 203) — replaces Diffie-Hellman
  - CRYSTALS-Dilithium (ML-DSA, FIPS 204) — replaces ECDSA
  - SPHINCS+ (SLH-DSA, FIPS 205) — alternative signatures
- **EO-14412 (June 2026):** US Executive Order mandating government-wide PQC migration with binding deadlines
- **EU NIS2 Directive:** implicitly requires PQC preparedness for critical infrastructure
- **Cyber insurance providers** now ask about PQC compliance at renewal (Lloyd's 2026)
- **Only 5% of enterprises** have actually migrated as of mid-2026
- **$15 billion** estimated PQC migration market

The gap between mandate and reality is the market.

## The Problem Enterprises Have

Companies don't know where their quantum-vulnerable cryptography lives. It's hidden everywhere:

- TLS certificates on every subdomain
- Code libraries importing OpenSSL, BouncyCastle, Java Cryptography
- JWT tokens signed with ECDSA
- SSH keys on every server
- VPN configurations
- S3 bucket encryption settings
- API authentication tokens
- Hardcoded keys buried in config files
- Code signing certificates
- Docker image signing

A mid-size company might have 400 certificates across 80 subdomains, 12 backend services using RSA, and JWT tokens signed with ECDSA across their entire auth layer — and their security team has no inventory of any of it.

**The #1 complaint from CISOs attempting migration: "We don't know what we have."**

## What Quantsiv Does — Product Modules

### 1. Code Scanner
Parses source code (Python, Java, Go, JavaScript, C++) at AST level to find every use of quantum-vulnerable algorithms:
- `RSA.generate(2048)` in Python
- `new RSAKeyPairGenerator()` in Java
- `crypto.createSign('SHA256withRSA')` in Node
- Config files specifying `algorithm: RSA`

### 2. Certificate Scanner
Scans every subdomain and endpoint via TLS handshake inspection. Flags:
- RSA-2048 and ECDSA P-256 certificates (both quantum-vulnerable)
- Certificate expiry dates (combined migration planning)
- Public-facing vs. internal classification

### 3. Cloud Infrastructure Scanner
Connects via AWS / Azure / GCP SDK. Checks:
- S3 bucket encryption algorithms
- RDS database encryption keys
- Lambda function signing certificates
- Load balancer SSL policies

### 4. Risk Scorer
Prioritises findings by two axes:
- **Exposure:** public-facing API vs. internal service
- **Sensitivity:** financial data, health records, authentication = higher risk

Output: ordered migration backlog, not a flat list.

### 5. CI/CD Integration (GitHub Action)
Scans every pull request. If new RSA or ECDSA usage is introduced, the build fails with a clear explanation. Prevents the problem from getting worse while the team works through existing debt. Same pattern as how Snyk works for dependency vulnerabilities.

### 6. Compliance Reporter
One-click PDF showing:
- NIST PQC compliance percentage
- CNSA 2.0 readiness score
- Migration roadmap with effort estimates
- Board-ready summary
- Cyber insurance questionnaire pre-fill

## Competitive Landscape

### Open-source CLI tools (free, narrow, no product wrapper)

| Tool | Who | What it does | What's missing |
|---|---|---|---|
| pqcscan (Anvil Secure) | Anvil Secure CTO | Scans SSH/TLS endpoints for PQC support | Can't scan codebases, no cloud, no compliance |
| pqc-scan (wakaken) | Independent, Rust CLI | Scans repos, generates CBOM, SARIF output | No dashboard, no SaaS, no cloud scanning |
| cryptoscan (CSNP/QRAMM) | CSNP community | Codebase scanner, CBOM, GitHub integration | No SaaS wrapper, no compliance reports, no UI |

These validate the technical approach. The engine works. But they're CLI tools, not products.

### Enterprise players (real products, inaccessible pricing)

| Player | Status | Why not a threat |
|---|---|---|
| SandboxAQ | $5.75B valuation, $950M raised, AQtive Guard product | Custom enterprise contracts, Fortune 500 / government only |
| AppViewX AVX ONE | Enterprise SaaS, PKI-focused | Enterprise pricing, long sales cycles |
| TYCHON Quantum Command | Government-focused | Not developer-first |
| Cryptosense | Acquired by Veracode 2022 | Buried in enterprise platform |

### The gap

The PQC middle layer — developer-first SaaS, self-serve, €99/month entry, compliance reporting, cloud scanning — is genuinely empty.

The market structure is identical to security scanning in 2015: open-source tools existed, enterprise players existed, nothing in the middle for the developer who wants `npm install pqc-check` and a dashboard. Snyk built in that gap and sold to Broadcom for $7B.

**Quantsiv is not inventing the scanner. Quantsiv is building the product nobody has wrapped around the scanner yet.**

### The broader "wrapper" ecosystem — not competitors, upstream customers

A second category of players exists: companies that implement quantum-safe wrappers over existing infrastructure (QuSecure, ExeQuantum, PQShield, CryptoNext Security, 01 Quantum). These are not competitors.

| These "wrapper" companies | Quantsiv |
|---|---|
| **Wrap** existing systems with quantum-safe layers | **Scans** to find where wrapping is needed |
| Answer: "How do we become quantum-safe?" | Answers: "Where are we quantum-vulnerable?" |
| Step 3 of the migration journey | Step 1 of the migration journey |

Every company that uses QuSecure or PQShield to implement quantum-safe wrappers **needed Quantsiv first** to know what to wrap. The implementation ecosystem growing (Palo Alto, Cisco, IBM, AWS all adding PQC layers) means the migration wave is real — and every migration starts with discovery. Quantsiv owns step 1.

## First Revenue Scenario

1. Build free scanner, open-source the engine on GitHub
2. Post on Hacker News: *"Show HN: Free PQC scanner for your codebase — tells you what breaks when quantum arrives"*
3. 300–500 security engineers use it in week 1
4. 10–20 want CI/CD integration and dashboard → €99/month = €1,000–2,000 MRR
5. One company needs a compliance report for their board → €500–1,500 one-time
6. First enterprise pilot at €2,000/month by month 4–5

**Realistic by month 6:** €3,000–8,000 MRR from developer subscriptions + early enterprise pilots.

## Tagline Options

- *"Know your quantum risk."*
- *"Your encryption has an expiry date."*
- *"Find every quantum-vulnerable algorithm before they find you."*

## Buzz Strategy — Stealth Mode

**The play:** make noise about the threat, not the solution. Become the person who understands quantum cryptography risk. Quantsiv reveals itself later as the answer being built the whole time.

### LinkedIn content sequence (one post per week)

**Post 1 — The hook:**
> *"Your encryption will be worthless within 10 years. State actors know this. They're collecting your encrypted data right now. This is called 'harvest now, decrypt later' — and almost no company has a plan for it."*

**Post 2 — The regulation angle:**
> *"NIST finalized quantum-resistant encryption standards in 2024. A US Executive Order mandated migration in 2026. Only 5% of enterprises have acted. What happens to the other 95%?"*

**Post 3 — The teaser:**
> *"Been heads-down building something in the quantum security space. More soon."*

**Post 4 — The waitlist drop:**
> *"Quantsiv is coming. If you're responsible for security at your company and you've been thinking about post-quantum migration — you want to be on this list."* [link]

## Strategic Position

Quantsiv sits at the intersection of three converging forces:

1. **Regulatory pressure** — binding deadlines, compliance requirements, cyber insurance mandates
2. **Technical urgency** — harvest now decrypt later is an active threat, not a future one
3. **Market gap** — enterprise tools exist, CLI tools exist, developer-friendly SaaS does not

The scanner is the entry point. The platform is the moat. The same security and engineering teams that use Quantsiv for PQC scanning become the pipeline for expanded quantum services as the ecosystem matures.

**Quantsiv is not a bet on quantum computers existing. It is a bet on companies being afraid they will — which is already true.**
